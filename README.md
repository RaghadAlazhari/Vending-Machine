# Vending Machine Money

In a vending machine, the system should track money not as just a sum but as bills and coins as well, when a customer requests to buy an item and enters the money that he has you need to make sure that change can be returned.

For example, if we have a 10 Dinars bill, and someone is asking for 5 Dinars in return, you cannot return the money, but if you have 10 one dinar bills you can return five one-dinar bills.
